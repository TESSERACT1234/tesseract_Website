                    <h3>Our Production Method</h3>
                    <p>
                        At Tesseract Flex Fuel, we use a continuous transesterification process to convert a wide range of feedstocks‚Äî
                        including used cooking oil, acid oils, and non-edible oils (Concept is to make Waste to Wealth)‚Äîinto high-quality biodiesel (B100).
                        Our fully automated plant employs cutting-edge technologies for:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Efficient oil pre-treatment and degumming</li>
                        <li>Precise methanol and catalyst dosing</li>
                        <li>High-yield transesterification reactors</li>
                        <li>Automated glycerol separation and purification</li>
                        <li>Advanced distillation and polishing for fuel-grade biodiesel</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        The entire process is monitored in real-time using IoT-enabled sensors and SCADA systems to ensure consistent quality and compliance with international biodiesel standards such as ASTM D6751 and EN 14214.
